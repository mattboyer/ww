##About ww

 WW is an enhanced remake of the classic w(1) utility, but also displays further information on the users as well as the host on which it runs and the way in which each session has been created on that host.

GNT is a GTK-style toolkit built on top of ncurses that provides Text User Interface (TUI) widgets, windowing and window management facilities. GNT is currently maintained as part of the [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/). Instant Messaging client for GNOME desktops.

##Compatibility

WW has been tested on the following OS/Platform combinations:

* Solaris 11 (main dev platform)  / x86
* Solaris 10                      / SPARCv9
* NetBSD 5.1                      / AMD64
* Linux (Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat) / VirtualBox VM

##Dependencies

WW has dependencies against:

* gnt - gnt's presence should ensure that the following dependencies common to WW and gnt are satisfied:
    - ncurses
    - glib-2.0
    - gobject-2.0
    - gthread-2.0

* libkvm on NetBSD

* CMake - CMake is only required for building WW

##Build instructions

WW uses CMake for source configuration and Makefile generation.
Assuming the WW source files have been extracted in a directory named
'ww_source' relative to the current working directory, WW can be built by
doing:

```
$ mkdir ww_staging
$ cd ww_staging
$ cmake ../ww_source

$ make
```

Do note that depending on your system, you may have to run 'gmake' instead of
'make', as the Makefiles generated by CMake may not play nice with non-GNU
implementations of make.
