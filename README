WW
==

See AUTHORS for the list of contributors.

WW is a GNT-based tool that aims to provide a cross-platform way to examine
open sessions on a *NIX system. WW is an enhanced remake of the classic w(1)
utility, but also displays further information on the users as well as the host
on which it runs and the way in which each session has been created on that
host.

GNT is a GTK-style toolkit built on top of ncurses that provides Text User
Interface (TUI) widgets, windows and window management facilities. GNT is
currently maintained as part of the Pidgin Instant Messaging client for GNOME
desktops.

BUILD
=====

WW uses CMake for source configuration and Makefile generation.
Assuming the WW source files have been extracted in a directory named
'ww_source' relative to the current working directory, WW can be built by
doing:
---
$ mkdir ww_staging
$ cd ww_staging
$ cmake ../ww_source

$ make
---

Do note that depending on your system, you may have to run 'gmake' instead of
'make', as the Makefiles generated by CMake may not play nice with non-GNU
implementations of make.

DEPENDENCIES
============

WW has dependencies against:

	gnt	- gnt should provide the following dependencies for WW:
		ncurses
		glib-2.0
		gobject-2.0
		gthread-2.0

	libkvm on BSD operating systems

	CMake	- CMake is only required for building ww

RUN
===

Run 'ww' in the staging directory and you should be presented with a windowed
UI on your terminal or terminal emulator.

When running ww inside a terminal emulator, it is advisable to use a window at
least 110 columns wide and 30 rows high.

You can exit ww by pressing Ctrl-c of Alt-q from within ww.
